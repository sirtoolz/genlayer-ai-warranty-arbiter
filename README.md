Genlayer
# ⚖️ GenLayer AI Warranty Arbiter

This project is built for the **GenLayer Testnet (Builders Path)**. It demonstrates an Intelligent Contract that uses AI and Web Access to settle disputes on-chain.

## 🚀 Why GenLayer?
Unlike Solidity contracts, this project requires:
1. **Web Scraper:** To read product descriptions directly from the internet.
2. **AI Reasoning:** To determine if a user's complaint is logically valid based on those specs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Contract:** Python (GenLayer SDK)
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Network:** GenLayer Testnet (Asimov)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/contracts`: Contains `warranty_arbiter.gpy` (The Intelligent Contract)
- `/src`: React frontend code connecting to the GenLayer RPC.
